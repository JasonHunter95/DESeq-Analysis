## Abstract
Chromatin accessibility is often viewed as a prerequisite for rapid transcriptional responses, yet the relationship can be context‑dependent. Here we profiled open chromatin in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) across a 2.5‑hour doxycycline (dox) time‑course (0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 min; one biological replicate each) using the nf‑core/ATAC‑seq v2.1.2 pipeline. MACS2 identified 70–100 k broad peaks per sample. A custom find_common_peaks workflow revealed 37,152 constitutive peaks shared by all time points, mapping preferentially to promoters of protein‑coding genes (≈ 63 % overlap) rather than lncRNAs (≈ 20 %).
To pinpoint dynamic sites, we (i) compared common‑peak sets between 0 min and all dox‑treated samples and (ii) applied DESeq2 to nf‑core‑generated featureCounts for 159,000 consensus peaks. Only 1,549 peaks emerged as “gained” and 16,312 as “lost” by simple overlap, yet DESeq2 detected no peaks with adjusted p < 0.05, even after low‑count filtering and shrinkage. In contrast, matched RNA‑seq data revealed >900 differentially expressed genes.
Our results indicate that dox elicits pronounced transcriptomic changes without large‑scale chromatin opening or closing, implying a chromatin‑independent mechanism—such as modulation of transcriptional machinery or RNA stability—during the early response window. These findings refine the paradigm that accessibility shifts are a universal correlate of rapid gene regulation and provide a high‑confidence set of 37 k constitutive ATAC sites that define the basal mESC state.

## Introduction
### Biological context
Chromatin accessibility governs which regulatory elements are competent to engage transcriptional machinery. In mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), open chromatin marks core pluripotency genes and thousands of distal enhancers that together maintain the naïve state. Acute environmental or chemical cues can trigger rapid transcriptional re‑programming, often—but not always—preceded by local chromatin remodelling.

Doxycycline (dox) is widely used as an inducer in Tet‑ON/OFF systems; however, multiple reports note pleiotropic effects on mitochondrial function, stress pathways, and global mRNA levels independent of the transgene of interest. Whether these transcriptomic shifts require accompanying changes in chromatin accessibility during the first few hours of exposure remains unresolved.

### Experimental question & hypothesis
Question. Does short‑term (≤ 150 min) doxycycline exposure reshape the open‑chromatin landscape in mESCs?
Hypothesis. Early transcriptional responses to dox occur largely without widespread opening or closing of chromatin, implying a mechanism that acts downstream of accessibility (e.g. altered transcriptional elongation, mRNA stability, or mitochondrial retrograde signalling).

### Study design

We performed nf‑core/ATAC‑seq (v2.1.2) on biological replicates collected at 0 min (non‑dox) and five post‑treatment time points (30–150 min). MACS2 broad peaks and nf‑core‑generated featureCounts tables provided the basis for:

Peak landscape QC – per‑sample counts, FRiP, constitutive peak set.

Binary overlap analysis – “closing” vs “opening” peaks between 0 min and post‑dox samples.

Quantitative testing – DESeq2 on read counts for 159 k consensus peaks.

Functional annotation – intersection with GENCODE vM25 promoters and RNA‑seq differential genes.

Manual validation – IGV inspection of top statistical and overlap candidates.


### Pipeline overview
```{r pipeline-overview, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="nf-core/ATAC-seq pipeline overview", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/atacseq_workflow.png")
```
The nf‑core/ATAC‑seq pipeline (Figure 1) automated all primary processing steps—pre‑processing, genome alignment, QC, peak calling, and per‑peak quantification—ensuring a reproducible foundation for downstream analyses.
